dating
======

My friend, Lauren McCarthy asked if I want to go on a date with her new app.
 

<p>This is <a href="http://www.crowdpilot.me/" title="Title">

I said yes, because we have been talking about these stuff recently. And I had no success with Coffee Meets Bagle, OkCupid and Howaboutwe so far, after one month of trying.    


I will keep a repo of before, during and after the date.
I'm not sure how I should use this repo just yet. 
Maybe I will put a list of concerns I have for the date. 

If you are interested in helping out, you can

* fork this repo
* make edits, change plans, thoughts
* ?//should participants be able to merge into the repo? or should they just publish on their branch? 
* more soon 

Please fork after 11 AM tomorrow, because the repo will be still empty and not full of goodies until that point.  
I won't look at the repo after 5PM tomorrow, becasue I have to go to the date and use Lauren't app Crowd Pilot. At that point you can help with through the app. 
Maybe I will come back home tomorrow night and document what happened during the date here.
