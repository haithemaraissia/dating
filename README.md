dating
======

My friend Lauren McCarthy asked if I want to go on a date with her new app.
 
This is [the project's website](http://www.crowdpilot.me/).

I said yes, because we have been talking about these things recently. And I had no success with [Coffee Meets Bagle](https://coffeemeetsbagel.com/), [OkCupid](https://www.okcupid.com/) and [HowAboutWe](http://www.howaboutwe.com/) so far, after one month of trying.

I will keep a repo of before, during and after the date.

I'm not sure how I should use this repo just yet.

Maybe I will put a list of concerns I have for the date. 

If you are interested in helping out, you can:

* fork this repo
* make edits, change plans, thoughts
* should participants be able to merge into the repo? or should they just publish on their branch? 
* more soon

Please fork after 11 AM tomorrow, because the repo will be still empty,and not full of goodies until that point.  

I won't look at the repo after 5PM tomorrow, becasue I have to go to the date and use Lauren's app Crowdpilot. At that point you can help through the app. 

Maybe I will come back home tomorrow night and document what happened during the date here.
