dating
======

My friend Lauren McCarthy asked if I want to go on a date with her new app.
 
This is [the project's website](http://www.crowdpilot.me/).

I said yes, because we have been talking about these things recently. And I had no success with [Coffee Meets Bagle](https://coffeemeetsbagel.com/), [OkCupid](https://www.okcupid.com/) and [HowAboutWe](http://www.howaboutwe.com/) so far, after one month of trying.
Lauren said "I think the chances of it being your future wife might be low but I thought it could be a funny, weird, interesting date experience to have." 

I am trying this to prover her wrong. May this be the path to find my true love. 

I will keep a repo of before, during and after the date.

I'm not sure how I should use this repo just yet.

Maybe I will put a list of concerns I have for the date. 

If you are interested in helping out, you can:

* fork this repo
* make edits, change plans, thoughts
* should participants be able to merge into the repo? or should they just publish on their branch? 
* more soon

Please fork after 11 AM tomorrow, because the repo will be still empty,and not full of goodies until that point.  

I won't look at the repo after 5PM tomorrow, becasue I have to go to the date and use Lauren's app Crowdpilot. At that point you can help through the app. 

Maybe I will come back home tomorrow night and document what happened during the date here.


Technical info:
====
1. Download the app (iPhone and iOS 7 required).
www.crowdpilot.me (will be live for download tomorrow AM)
2. Choose start a session. Make sure "let the public assist you is checked", then choose select a situation. Choose date.
3. On the Crowdpilot brief section, input anything but include the hashtag #rhizome. You might also want to give some indication who you are if both of you are using the app. (ex: "I am a woman on a date, help me woo him! #rhizome")

That's it! You need to leave the app open (if doesn't work in the background, so don't switch to another app or go back to the home screen). If you stop getting suggestions for a while, try force quitting the app and restarting a session. 
 
Issues at hand 
====
1. Meet at the New Museum Lobby or somewhere else?: Michael Connor (from Rhizome) told me to meet at a restarurant next to the NuMu, and order a drink and an appetizer but get food somewhere else. 
2. Should I get a flower for my date? or should I find a time during the date to get her a flower? 
3. Should I take my camera or leave it at home? 
4. Should I use my real name, or be anonymous?: Kyle McDonald said I should be myself so other people can help me out better (knowing who I am), and Michael said staying anonymous may make it feel easier. "More anonymous style is better! You will feel more comfortable." 
5. Where to go to get dinner? The place needs to be close to the NuMu and sort of quiet. 
6. What to talk about? Kyle said I should not worry about what to talk about, but what I would ask her. 
7. What to ask her? family, job, friends, life, or this project? 
8. Should I take my date to this seminar on [Excommunication?] (http://events.newschool.edu/event/excommunication_three_inquiries_in_media_and_mediation_by_alexander_galloway_eugene_thacker_and_mckenzie_wark#.Uvuf1UJdWTG) It happens in the same time as the date. I didn't know this is happening until just now. 

"Always connect"—that is the imperative of today’s media. But what about those moments when media cease to function properly, when messages go beyond the sender and receiver to become excluded from the world of communication itself—those messages that state: “There will be no more messages”? In this book, Alexander R. Galloway, Eugene Thacker, and McKenzie Wark turn our usual understanding of media and mediation on its head by arguing that these moments reveal the ways the impossibility of communication is integral to communication itself—instances they call excommunication.

//long time ago, I took my blind date to a sound art concert (in a university, and my friends were playing laptop noise) I didn't get to see her after the concert. Maybe that's telling something.
